## 📑 Task 7: Making Objects Dynamic with Physics ⭐⭐ 200 Karma Points  

Apply **physics** to objects in a scene in **Unreal Engine 5** to enhance realism. Enable features like gravity, collisions, and physical interactions, allowing objects to respond naturally to forces such as pushes, pulls, or impacts.  

---

### 📌 Step 1: Enable Physics  
Enable physics for objects in your scene using Unreal Engine’s physics system. Configure:  
- Gravity  
- Collision  
- Physical interactions  

🔗 [Unreal Engine Physics Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/physics-in-unreal-engine/)  

### 📌 Step 2: Adjust Physics Properties  
Fine-tune physics properties such as:  
- Mass  
- Friction  
- Damping  

Experiment with forces like pushes, pulls, or rotations to test interactions.  

### 📌 Step 3: Test Behavior  
Test the setup to ensure objects behave naturally within the environment. Verify interactions with:  
- The player  
- Environmental factors  

### 📌 Step 4: Documentation  
Document the physics settings applied and how they affect objects in a **README** file.  

### 📌 Step 5: Submission  
Submit your project in the [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/771670169691881483/1315007911449071706) using the hashtag **#cl-game-dev-physics** to earn ⭐ 200 Karma Points.
